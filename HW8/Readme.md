This subdirectory contains code for matrix operations in both c and c++

matrixC.c : all source code for c implementation
matrix.h : header file for c++ implementation
matrix.cpp : .cpp file for c++ implementation
main.cpp : contains main() for c++ implementation
makefile : makefile commands for compiling both programs

To build using the makefile: 
'make mainCPP' will create the runnable mainCPP from matrix.h, matrix.cpp, and main.cpp
'make mainC' will create the runnable mainC from matrixC.c
