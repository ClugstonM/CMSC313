The most clear difference is the length of each program. addmatsSimple.s is only 49 lines, addmatsSubr. is 90 lines, and addmats.s is 135 lines, this increase in length directly corresponding to the increasing complexity of each program's source code.

Immediately above the label for main, all three programs have ".globl main" and ".type main, @function". addmatsSubr.s also has ".globl addMatracies" and ".type addMatracies @function", presumably because it is the only program that has a global function (aside from main).

addmatsSimple.s has a label for main and four labels indented in it. addmatsSubr.s has a label for addMatrices with four labels indented in it and two labels indented in the label for main. addmats.s has a label for the MatrixFunctions class with 7 corresponding labels (including one for the addMatricies function) and two labels indented in the main label. 
 
The label corresponding to the addMatracies function for addmatsSubr.s is aptly named "addMatracies" but the label in addmats.s is named "_ZN15MatrixFunctions12addMatraciesEPiS0_S0_" including both the class (MatrixFunctions) and the function (addMatracies) surrounded by unintelligible letters and numbers. The label corresponding to the class is similarly surrounded by seemingly random letters and numbers. 

Compared to addmatsSimple.s, both addmatsSubr.s and addmats.s add several leal and pushl calls before calling the corresponding addMatricies function. Aside from that, the main labels, when viewed in conjunction with addMatricies for addmatsSubr.s and addmats.s, appear quite similar for all three, being a bunch of movl calls before moving into a loop of movl and addl calls. 
What appears to be the iteration loop (.L3 and .L2 in addmatsSimple.s and addmatsSubr.s, and .L4 and .L3 in addmats.s) is similar in all three, but more complex in addmatsSubr.s and addmats.s, containing more addl calls and several leal calls that don't exist in addmatsSimple.s. This part is nearly identical between addmatsSubr.s and addmats.s, with the only notable difference being two additional movl calls in addmats.s.
