This subdirectory contains matrix libraries operations in both c and c++


1. matrixC.c : all source code for c implementation
2. matrix.h : header file for c++ implementation
3. matrix.cpp : .cpp file for c++ implementation
4. main.cpp : contains main() for c++ implementation
5. makefile : makefile commands for compiling both programs


To build using the makefile: 
- 'make mainCPP' will create the runnable mainCPP from c++ code (matrix.h, matrix.cpp, and main.cpp)
- 'make mainC' will create the runnable mainC from c code (matrixC.c)
